# HCI Blog

This repository contains the source code for a personal website, created as part of an HCI course in my Master’s program in Virtual and Augmented Reality (VAR).

The site was built using Hugo, a fast static site generator, and is hosted using GitHub Pages.
It includes blog posts documenting my weekly lab and lectures work.

The goal of this project was to explore web-based documentation, practice clear communication, and learn how to structure a lightweight, maintainable website.
