# Lecture 1: Affordances

Find and documents (Video/Picture) one bad and one good affordance in your daily life.. 
Explain why they are good or bad and suggest how you could fix the bad ones.

## Good affordance (in daily life):

The handle of a mug, the curved handle naturally affords grasping / holding. Even without instructions, you see "I can grab here".

It's a good affordance because the design conveys the possible action clearly and intuitively to the user. The user doesn’t have to think too hard, the shape hints the behavior.

## Bad affordance (in daily life):

A door with a vertical bar handle on the push side. That handle visually suggests “pull me,” but in reality you are supposed to push. This mismatch leads to confusion or hesitation.

Why it’s bad? The perceived affordance (what the user thinks they can do) differs from the actual affordance (what the designer intended). This breaks usability and causes errors.

How to fix the bad one: Replace the vertical bar handle (on the push side) with a flat plate or push plate, so it doesn’t invite pulling.
